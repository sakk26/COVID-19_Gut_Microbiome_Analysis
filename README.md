# COVID-19_Gut_Microbiome_Analysis
This project explores the relationship between gut microbiome composition and COVID-19 severity, along with the impact of patient demographics and comorbidities. Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis Species-Level Associations with COVID-19 Severity Association of Metadata with Gut Microbiome Composition Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Severity
Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis: Investigating variations in Pielou Evenness, Shannon Index, and overall microbiome abundance patterns across different severity groups using appropriate statistical tests and visualization techniques.
Species-Level Associations with COVID-19 Severity: Identifying species significantly associated with COVID-19 severity before and after adjusting for confounders such as age, BMI, gender, and comorbidities.
Association of Metadata with Gut Microbiome Composition: Assessing the association of patient metadata (age, gender, BMI, comorbidities, etc.) with overall gut microbiome composition using appropriate statistical tests and ranking metadata based on association strength.
Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Severity: Evaluating the feasibility of predicting COVID-19 severity using gut microbiome profiles and patient metadata (age, BMI, gender, comorbidities) through machine-learning classifiers (Random Forest, SVM). The top 50 predictive features are identified, and classification performance is assessed both overall and specifically between mild and critical_severe groups.
